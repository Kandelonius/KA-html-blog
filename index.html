            I first became interested in computer science because 
            I wanted to be involved in making games. I have had an
            interest in games my whole life, and I wanted to be part
            of the industy that has given me so much joy over the 
            years. I knew that in order to get into computer                   science
            I'd have to do a lot of math, which I actively avoided 
            in high school.<br> 
            When I decided to go back to school I had to start 
            at pre algebra because I had been out of school so 
            long and forgotten what little I once knew. I had a 
            long road ahead of me but I had decided it was time 
            to get out of my entry level employment loop and 
            try to invest myself into something that interests 
            me. I noticed as I worked my way through the 
            mathematics I actually started to like it quite a 
            bit. I have always enjoyed puzzles and various 
            forms of problem solving. I am glad I was able to 
            get past my initial distaste for math because I 
            really do enjoy the world of <strong>STEM</strong>
            it has allowed me to enter.

            One thing I found while working through my math was 
            Khan Academy. I kept getting stuck on my problems and 
            I would look up the individual concepts and this same 
            person with really clear explanations kept popping up. 
            I eventually dug deeper and found that there was a 
            website with all of these videos in one place. After 
            I found KA I started to find other open source 
            websites. I was amazed at how much was available for
            free. By the time I got to my first programming class
            I was using a site to follow the Stanford equivilant
            of the java class I was taking at my local community
            college.

                My 'why' for Lambda school project day 3. I have had 
                a long history with post high school education but have 
                not been able to make it work for myself. I have had 
                advocates in the past but I kept getting hung up on 
                something. Fresh out of high school I lacked motivation 
                and any direction, so I just entered the job market 
                doing whatever I could for a job. After 2010 I found 
                the motivation I needed and returned to school for 
                computer science and was able to do really well as 
                long as I focused and kept my goals in mind. Once I 
                got into university that changed though because I was 
                no longer able to make things work financially due to 
                the fact that it requires more money to go to university 
                than it does a community college. I enjoy the problem 
                solving aspects of programming and the step by step nature 
                of the problem solving process, so I believe this is the 
                correct path for me. I really like that Lambda School gives 
                people the opportunities that are lacking in other areas of 
                society regardless of background. I hope that I will be able 
                to pay back the full $30k for my tuition because that will 
                mean I am making more money than I ever expected I would be 
                making. I also sincerely hope I work for a company I am proud 
                of and I believe if I am in an industry where I am likely to 
                earn a livable wage will have the luxury of being picky in 
                that way. Thank you for giving me this opportunity, I will 
                try my best to meet or exceed what is asked of me.
