        <p>I first became interested in computer science because 
            I wanted to be involved in making games. I have had an
            interest in games my whole life, and I wanted to be part
            of the industy that has given me so much joy over the 
            years. I knew that in order to get into computer science
            I'd have to do a lot of math, which I actively avoided 
            in high school.<br> 
            When I decided to go back to school I had to start 
            at pre algebra because I had been out of school so 
            long and forgotten what little I once knew. I had a 
            long road ahead of me but I had decided it was time 
            to get out of my entry level employment loop and 
            try to invest myself into something that interests 
            me. I noticed as I worked my way through the 
            mathematics I actually started to like it quite a 
            bit. I have always enjoyed puzzles and various 
            forms of problem solving. I am glad I was able to 
            get past my initial distaste for math because I 
            really do enjoy the world of STEM it has allowed 
            me to enter.
